ABOUT THE HANDBOOK

Information & Communication Technology has become an integral part of our day to day life. It has changed the way we connect with friends, find jobs, find matches for marrying, run businesses, play games, do shopping and so on. With the cheap availability of broadband and smartphones, almost everyone has access to the cyber space, connecting virtually to millions of online users across the globe. Increasing use of cyber space has also made us vulnerable to cybercrime threats. A minor lapse/negligence in managing our digital life can open the doors for cybercrimes and hence can lead to financial loss, damage to reputation, harassment etc. So, we must be vigilant and careful while connecting digitally to the outside world whether for financial transactions, social networking, playing games or searching things on the internet etc.
 The information provided in this handbook is intended to create awareness among citizens about various cyber threats that can impact them and provide some tips to safeguard themselves against cybercrimes.
The initial part of the booklet depicts the different types of cybercrimes being reported these days, categorized as per their modus operandi. For cybercrime of each modus operandi, we have given its brief description in the box at the top. Below that, is a pictorial representation of how cyber criminals commit that particular cybercrime on the victim. We have tried to keep it simple so that even a common man can understand it. At the bottom of the page are the tips/possible ways by which one can avoid the particular cybercrime/fraud.
There might be certain overlapping tricks found in the various types of cybercrimes explained in the handbook. Still they have been discussed separately because cyber criminals apply some common tricks with very subtle differences because of which many people become victims.
As it is not possible to cover all the different modus operandi in a small handbook, hence, we have provided general tips for ensuring one's safety in cyber space towards the end of the booklet. People, who do not have time to read each modus operandi in detail, are advised to at least go through these general tips and follow them to prevent themselves from becoming a victim of cybercrime.

CVV/OTP SHARING FRAUD

Cyber criminals posing themselves as bank /RBI officials call people and tell them that their ATM card has been blocked or their KYC (Know Your Customer) is not updated or their Aadhaar is not linked to their bank account & hence their account will be blocked. Then on the pretext of updating the KYC/linking bank account to Aadhaar or for resuming the services of ATM card/activation of new ATM card asks for details related to victim's bank account like ATM card number, CVV number, OTP etc. After these details are shared by victim, money is siphoned off from the victim's bank account.

PAY/PHONEPE/PAYTM








Fraudster calls the vendors or any shopkeeper or businessman & requests for Google Pay or PhonePe registered mobile number for making payment



Instead of recieving money, victim ends up paying to the fraudster via request money QR code or link




















 Victim ignores the text message received on the registered phone number with one's bank account

Frauds are also committed by cyber criminals posing themselves as buyers to real sellers. In this modus operandi, cyber criminals get the seller's account debited on the pretext of paying advance money by sending request money link/QR code instead of the credit link/QR code.








Army/para-military force personnel upload commodity (vehicle/fridge
/mobile phone etc.) to be sold on Olx
/Quikr/Facebook etc.

Cyber criminals contact these personnel & get their id proof, canteen smart card and other documents on the pretext of buying the advertised item

Now, the cyber criminal is able to access all the bank account details linked to the victim's mobile number and withdraws the money

The TSP closes the services of victim's old SIM and issues the victim's mobile number to the blank SIM card

For Device/Computer Security
* Keep your antivirus and operating system updated at all times.
* Backup your sensitive/important data at regular intervals.
* Be careful while opening suspicious web links/URLs.
* Always scan external storage devices (e.g. USB) for viruses, while connecting to your device.

* Wireless router can screen the MAC addresses of all devices connected to it, and users can set their wireless network to accept connections only from devices with MAC addresses recognized by the router.
* Secure all your wireless access points with a strong password. Hackers usually scan for open access points and may misuse it to carry out unwanted activities. Log records may make you more vulnerable for such misuse.
* Merely deleting sensitive material is not sufficient, as it does not actually remove the data from your device. 'File Shredder Software' should be used to delete sensitive files on computers.
* Delete unwanted files or data from your computer device. It prevents unauthorized access to such data by others.
* Use 'Non-Administrator Account' privileges for login to the computer and avoid accessing with 'Administrator' privileges for day-to-day usage of computers.

* Avoid writing down or storing in mobile phones the information used to access digital wallets/bank accounts.
* One should not use the same password for internet banking of all accounts.
* One should not keep the same mobile number registered for all bank accounts.
* Always enable getting notification of transactions from the banks via both SMS & e-mail.
